/**
 * @brief Abstract configuration of object's provider
 * @see provider
 *
 * This object is used to create @see provider objects. Configurations are stored in @see module
 * and @see module_impl, providers are stored in @see injector_core objects.
 * 
 * Provider configuration contains only two methods: types() and create_provider(const types_by_name &).
 * First one is represents list of types that are known to provider (like factory type and created
 * object type), second one creates provider based on list of all known types.
 * 
 * This class is reqruied due to Qt limitations of interactions between plugins and QMetaType system.
 * If QMetaType have worked properly inside plugins it could be used to extract parameter and return
 * types of invokable methods (using QMetaMethod::returnType() and QMetaMethod::paremeterType() with
 * QMetaType::metaObjectForType(int). As it does not work, Injeqt stores all known QMetaObject in
 * common @see types_by_name structure (that can only by computed in @see injector when all modules are known)
 * and uses QMetaMethod::typeName() and QMetaMethod::returnType()::paramterTypes() to get names of
 * types, that are mapped using this @see types_by_name.
