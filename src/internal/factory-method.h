/**
 * @brief Abstraction of factory method.
 *
 * This class is used for creating objects of types configured with module::add_factory<T, F>().
 * Factory method is created from Qt type QMetaMethod. As Qt only creates QMetaMethod
 * objects for slots, signals and all methods marked with Q_INVOKABLE tag - Injeqt
 * requires that factory method is marked with that tag or is a slot. This method is must return
 * pointer of type inherited from QObject and is not allowed to have any parameters - even
 * with default values.
 *
 * Example of valid factory method:
 *
 *     class created_object : public QObject
 *     {
 *         Q_OBJECT
 *     };
 *
 *     class with_factory_method : public QObject
 *     {
 *         Q_OBJECT
 *     public:
 *         Q_INVOKABLE created_object * create() { ... }
 *     };
 *
 * To check if object is valid call validate(const factory_method &).
 * To extract constructor from a type call make_factory_method<T, F>().
 * For above example a call to make_factory_method<with_factory_method, created_object>()
 * would return valid object.
 *
 * Note that in Injeqt factory should not own created object - invoking
 * injector own lifetime of it. Method invoke(QObject *) call factory method
 * and immediately wraps returned QObject * in a std::unique_ptr that it later
 * returns.
