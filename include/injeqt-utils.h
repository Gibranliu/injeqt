/**
 * @brief Helper function for creating valid objects.
 * @tparam T type of object to create
 * @param args argumetns to T constructor
 *
 * In injeqt most of the object can be created both in valid and invalid state. It is assumed
 * that each object that comes or is constructor from objects from outside of library can be
 * invalid and must be checked by validate<T>(T) free function that throws exception when that
 * case occurs. Objects created inside library from other valid objects must be valid (it is
 * developer responsibility to ensure that this is true).
 *
 * For simplicity make_validated function was added. It created new object with provided arguments
 * and calls validate<T>(T) free function on it. It can only return objects that are valid -
 * otherwise an exception is thrown.
